# count-down-timer
The Countdown Timer is a simple yet dynamic web project that allows users to set a time duration and track it in real time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features start, pause, and reset functions with a clean, responsive interface. This project demonstrates my skills in DOM manipulation, time management, and UI design.
